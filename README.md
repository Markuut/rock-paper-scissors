# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Welcome to my implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This simple web-based game demonstrates core web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Git branching and merging for version control.

## About the Game
This project is a digital recreation of the timeless game where you play against the computer. The game is played in rounds, and the first to reach 3 points wins.

### The project was designed to:

- Showcase interactive DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Practice responsive web design with CSS for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Explore and implement Git workflows (branching and merging) during development.

#### How to Play
1. Choose Your Move: Click on one of the three buttons:
- ü™® Rock
- üìÑ Paper
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors

2. Computer's Turn: The computer randomly selects its move.

3. Win or Lose: The game compares your move and the computer's move based on the rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beat Paper

4. First to 3 Wins: The game continues until either you or the computer scores 3 points.

### Features
- Dynamic Gameplay: The game updates scores and displays results dynamically using JavaScript.
- Restart Functionality: Once the game ends, you can restart with the "Play Again" button.
- User Feedback: Real-time feedback on the moves made and results of each round.

## What I Learned
During the development of this project, I focused on building skills in both web development and Git workflows:

#### Technical Skills
1. HTML & CSS:
- Structuring HTML for a clean layout.
- Styling with CSS for a modern, responsive interface.

2. JavaScript (DOM Manipulation):
- Dynamically updating the DOM to reflect game state changes.
- Using event listeners to capture user interactions.

#### Git Version Control
1. Branching:
- Used Git branches to manage features independently (e.g., creating a feature branch for styling or game logic).
2. Merging:
- Merged completed branches into the main branch, resolving conflicts when needed.

#### Future Improvements
- The code of course could be more efficient.
- Add some kind of intelligence for the computer to recognize if user is spamming the same move.
